## Problem One:

Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if a majority of a randomly chosen congress is Republican. Calculate the confidence interval as well. You'll need to *recode* your data similar to the example in the lesson.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
```

## Problem Two:

Determine if there is a difference in money received from pro lobby groups and con lobby groups (test and interval). You'll need to clean the data by replacing missing values with 0 and filtering to a single political party of your choice.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
```
