## Base R vs Tidyverse
One of the major differences between base R and Tidyverse is the use of the pipe operator, ` %>% `, from the `magrittr` package. Starting with R version 4.0, there is a native (i.e. base R) pipe operator, `|>`. However, it behaves differently from the `magrittr` pipe. For the problems below, use the `magrittr` pipe for the Tidyverse problems and either the native pipe or no pipe for base R. 

### Problem One: 

Calculate the average number of study hours per week with base R and Tidyverse.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
```

### Challenge: 

Calculate the standard deviation for both variables with base R and Tidyverse.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
```

For the plots below, use the `ggplot2` package from the Tidyverse.

### Problem Two: 

Sketch a histogram for the study\_hours variable.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
```

### Challenge: 

Sketch a boxplot for each variable.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
```
