## Problem One: 
Choose a dataset from the openintro package and complete a linear model and analysis. You need to calculate or build: 

1. The correlation coefficient

2. A scatterplot without the model overlay

3. The regression table (and use it to determine if a relationship exists)

4. A scatterplot with the model overlay

5. Two predictions (1 interpolation, 1 extrapolation) with interpretations.
