### Problem One:
Re-create your histogram from lab 1 using a different color for the bars and a theme from the ggthemes package.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
```

### Problem Two: 
Create a custom histogram using one of the variables in the `diamonds` data set. It should include one (or more): 

*change to text

*change to panel

*change to plot

*change to histogram/boxplot

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
```
